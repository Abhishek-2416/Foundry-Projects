To sign and publish a transaction we can use something know as the cast
Like how we use the GUI in Remix to basically interact with the contract similarly we can do that same using the "cast send {the address of contract} "{the name of the function like store(uint256)} {the value we want to pass in } --rpc-url http://83897 --private-key",,, something like this cast send 0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0 "store(uint256)" 123 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
