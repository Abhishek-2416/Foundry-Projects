So instead of using the password directly into the .env file or else using it inside of the terminal, what we can do is store the private key in keystore and also encryting it 
To encrpt the private key and store it inside what we can do is use the "cast wallet import namethePrivateKey --interactive" then it will ask you for your private key and then ask a password to encrypt it 
Then now to use it to deploy the smart contracts, this how we can use it "forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url http://dhausd --account namethePrivateKey --sender theAddressOfSender --broadcast -vvv"
