 * 1. We need to pass the address of the rebase token in the constructor
 * 2. Create a deposit function which accpets the collateral and mint the tokens to the user equal to the amount of collateral they have deposited
 * 3. Create a redeem function which burns the tokens from the user and then send them back their collateral
 * 4. Create a way to add rewards into the vault
