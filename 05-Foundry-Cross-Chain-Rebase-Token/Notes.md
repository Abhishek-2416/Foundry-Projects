# Blockchain Bridges

- A blockchain bridge is a protocol that enables users to transfer assessts like tokens from one chain to another , hence there are various types of bridiging also 

1. Burn and Mint Bridge
- The tokens are burnt on the source chain and taken out of circulation
- These token the same amount is then minted on the destination chain
- Keeps the total supply constant

2. Lock and Unlock Bridge
- The funds are locked on a vault on the source chain
- Then unlocked on the vault on the destination chain
- This can lead to fragmented liquidity

3. Lock and mint Bridge
- Here lets say we already have few tokens with us and the protocol doesn't have the ability to burn or mint tokens
- So tokens are locked in the vault at the source chain
- Then new wrapped version of these tokens are minted on the destination chain
- Example USDCe

4. Burn and Unlock Bridge
- Here we first burn the tokens on the source chain
- Equivalent amount of tokens are then minted on the destination bridge issued from the vault
